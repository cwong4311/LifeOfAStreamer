Event A

A curious viewer approaches and asks what kind of game it is.
After a while, they still don't seem to get it, and continue to ask
questions (often mid-gameplay, which isn't really an issue if you're
not playing an actiony game). The streamer's options can be
characterised as: patient, non-committal, dismissive.
