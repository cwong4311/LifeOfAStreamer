Event B

A new viewer comes through and expresses surprise about the fact that there
is a streaming scene for this specific game (regardless of what game is being
played).

(PS: Chronologically Second)

--- [ 1 ] ---
X: Whoa, I didn't realise people were streaming this game.
X: I guess there's a niche for everything, though!

Responses:
    A. Haha yeah, I guess there's not a lot to watch... [Self-deprecating, -Morale]
    B. It's pretty fun! You've played before? [Engaging, +Morale]
    C. Yeah, it's surprisingly deep, actually. Also, some of the bugs look kinda funny. Watch this. [Engaging, +Morale]
    D. ... [Non-committal, -Morale]

--- [ 2A ] ---
X: Oh. Well, I'll stick aroudn until I get bored, lol.
X: *around
X: Don't disappoint me!
X: Gotta make sure you make SUITable content for this game lmao [Cards only]
X: You gotta show off the HEIGHT of your talents hahaha [Platformer only]
X: I don't wanna be SPACing out mid-stream now [Space invaders only]

Responses:
    I. Prepare to be impressed! [Boastful, +Morale (More if a high score is reached next?)]
    II. I don't think I can handle the pressure. [Sarcastic, Playful, +Morale]
    III. Puns aren't funny, lol [Discouraging, -Morale]

    IV. Don't worry, I think this stream'll MATCH your expectations :> [Cards, Playful, ++Morale]
    IV. Guess I can't let you down now, esp since you've taken such a LEAP of faith to keep watching! [Platformer, Playful, ++Morale]
    IV. I'll SHOOT for the stars! [Space invaders, Playful, ++Morale]


--- [ 3A.I ] ---  Same as [ 3B.II ]
X: Haha, okay, this should be good!
X: [At next high score] POG (from 1/2 present viewers, tweak numbers if you want)
    X: Wow, you weren't joking!

Wait for next event?

--- [ 3A.II ] --- Same as [ 3A.IV ], [ 3B.IV ], [ 3C.III ]
X: LOL
    X: [If 3A.IV, Space Invaders] Two whole puns at once!
X: That's pretty funny, actually.
    X: [If 3A.II] You just made this worse for yourself! I'm invested now.
Y: [Optional, pun only] Nooooo, not the puns D:

... Might put in extra lines but this is probably sufficient.
Should feel like a positive-ish interaction.
Wait for next event.

--- [ 3A.III ] ---
X: Oh, ok :(

End of event/wait for next event.

--- [ 3A.IV ] --- Same as [ 3A.II ]


==================================
--- [ 2B ] ---
X: A little bit! I wasn't very good at it, though.
X: I guess you could say I'm better SUITed to watching other people play! [Cards]
X: The game makes my anxiety spike, and I'm JUMPy enough as it is hahah [Platformer]
    X: It's easier to just watch, though.
X: The controls just felt a little too ALIEN to me, you know what I mean? [Space invaders]

Responses:
    I. The game's not that hard, lol. [Admonishing, -Morale]
    II. Well you're in luck: I'm a pro! Watch this. [Boastful, +Morale (bonus if high score?)]
    III. No shame in that. [Neutral]

    IV. I'm sure you could ACE this if you tried! [Cards, Playful, ++Morale]
    IV. Sometimes all it takes is a little leap of faith. [Platformer, Playful, ++Morale]
    IV. Yeah, I know it takes a little while to get used to the SPACing X: but it's worth it! [Space Invaders, Playful, ++Morale]

--- [ 3B.I ] ---

==================================
--- [ 2C ] ---
X: Whoa, I've never seen that one before!
X: Maybe that's why people don't stream it lol. Too buggy.
X: You're right tho that's pretty funny
X: Is the game really that deep, though? It looks pretty simple.

    II. Yeah. [Non-committal, -Morale]
    III. Nah, I was messing with you. [Playful, Neutral]
