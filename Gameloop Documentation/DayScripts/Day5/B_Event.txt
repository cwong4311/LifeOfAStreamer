Event B

A curious viewer approaches and asks what kind of game it is.
After a while, they still don't seem to get it, and continue to ask
questions (often mid-gameplay, which isn't really an issue if you're
not playing an actiony game). The streamer's options can be
characterised as: patient, non-committal, dismissive.

--- [ 1 ] ---
X: So like
X: What do you even do in this game?
X: Sorry I've been watching for a bit, and I still don't get it

Responses:
    A. Isn't it obvious? [Non-committal, -Morale]
    B. (Explain the game) [Helpful, +Morale]

--- [ 2A ] ---
X: No, not really...
Y: Seems pretty straightforward to me!
Y: [Cards only] You try matching the cards, and they disappear when you do.
    Y: The goal is to clear the board.
Y: [Platformer only] The player has to try not to fall while the world moves around them. It's a bit harder than it looks.
Y: [Space Invaders only] Things come in wanting to hurt the player! The player has to shoot them down before they become a problem.

Go to [ 2B ].

--- [ 2B ] ---
X: Hmm, I see...

--- [ 3 ] ---
Triggers after a couple more rounds of gameplay, hopefully
midway through a run.
X: I still don't get it.

Responses (All neutral except C):
    A. What's there not to get?
    B. What do you mean?
    C. Lol are you just trolling [Accusatory, -Morale]

--- [ 4A, 4B ] ---
X: I mean, like, why do you even do these things?
X: [Cards] Why flip the cards? Every time you clear the board, they just come back.
X: [Platformer] Is there a place you're trying to get to at the end? Are you running from something?
    X: Why does the little man keep coming back after he falls to his death?
X: [Space Invaders] What do the things want? When you shoot them, they just keep coming back.
    X: Doesn't look like shooting them really helps you, either...

Responses:
    I. You're definitely trolling. [Accusatory, -Morale]
    II. Hahaha, you're thinking about this too hard. It's just a game. [Dismissive, -Morale]
    III. Hmm, the game doesn't really say anything about that, sorry. I just like playing for the sake of playing. [Gentle, Neutral]
    IV. OFFICIALLY, there isn't a reason- but... (humour them, and make something up) [Engaging, Playful, +Morale]

--- [ 5A/B.I ] --- Same as [ 4C ]
X: No...
X: I don't even know what that means

Nothing until next event.

--- [ 5A/B.II ] ---
X: ... ok.

Nothing until next event.

--- [ 5A/B.III ] ---
X: Oh, I see
X: It must be fun to play, then, even if it's not that deep lol
X: Not the kind of game I'd normally play

See: [ 5A/B.IV ] for responses.

--- [ 5A/B.IV ] ---
X: Hahaha okay okay
X: You know for a moment I thought you were making fun of me
X: But that's actually pretty funny
X: I guess the game just isn't that deep
X: Not really the kind of game I'd normally play

Responses:
    A. Yeah, that's ok. Hope you like watching it, at least! [Friendly, +Morale]
    B. What kind of game do you normally play? [Engaging, +Morale]

--- [ 6A ] ---
X: Yeah, I think I'll stick around a bit
X: Maybe I'll get to see why you find it fun haha

Nothing until next event.

--- [ 6B ] ---
X: Last Reverie XVI
X: It's good
X: Really pretty
Y: Ohhh I've been meaning to try that one
X: I'm kinda trash at it though
X: My brother bought it for my birthday

Responses:
    A. Yeah? I've had my eye on that, too. Maybe I'll stream it someday. [Engaging, +Morale]
    B. Haven't really heard of that one, sorry. Must be very different. [Neutral]

--- [ 7A ] ---
X: That'd be really cool!
X: I've played it a lot but I really want to see what other people think about it
X: I don't normally play a lot of videogames but this one got me curious hahaha

Ends on a good note. Wait til next event.

--- [ 7B ] ---
X: Oh, that's ok
X: It's a very different game, yeah
Y: Lots more story lol
Y: Kinda like watching a movie sometimes
X: But like, a good movie
Y: Yeah, it's real quality from what I've watched
Y: Maybe you should stream it lol
