Overview:

> Bad Route will have player wake up to a lot of FX Overlay
for stress, anxiety, desire to not stream.

Players will be allowed free control oer slow, wobbly character
with these fx happening.

Slowly move towards pc, effects get worse.

When reaching PC, static cut to black. "I can't take this anymore"


> Good Route players will face the same thing, but once they
reach the pc, FX subsides. They start to stream as usual.

Comment flow will be similar to day 10, but players will only
have single choices that dissolve the trolling. Leading
to a comment flow similar to Day 9~10.

Fade to white after several successful interactions, with
text "I can do this after all."
